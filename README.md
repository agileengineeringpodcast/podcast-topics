# Podcast Topics

This repository is for topic submissions for discussion. Everyone can contribute!

You can view topics submitted under [issues](https://github.com/agileengineeringpodcast/podcast-topics/issues/) or you can [submit your own](https://github.com/agileengineeringpodcast/podcast-topics/issues/new)!

You can even join in on the discussion by commenting on issues.

Got a question rather than a specific topic? That's okay too.

## Submitting a topic for discussion

Each topic submitted for discussion needs the following:

- A descriptive title e.g. Debunking DevOps Myths
- A brief description of the subject matter e.g. DevOps is constantly sold as a silver bullet by a lot of people and usually ends up being a "cloud" or "infrastructure team" or worse yet, a rebranded Ops team.
- What around it you feel needs discussing e.g. How do we correct this and communicate what is DevOps really is and continue moving forwards

For questions:

- A descriptive title
- The question itself!
